## Intended use case â€” read me first

This middleware was originally created to compress verbose JSONAPI responses.
If you are considering this middleware for compressing static assets in
production, please consider using [nginx][nginx-url] or [lighttpd][lighttpd-url]
instead. These servers are vastly superior to Node.js in performance for serving
static assets.

## Setup

Install the provider from npm:

    adonis install @verdigris/adonis-compression

Next make sure to read the [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md) file.

## Node/OS Target

This repo/branch is intended to run on all major OS platforms and targets
`Node.js >= 8.0`

## Development

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn about the contribution
guidelines before contributing to this codebase.

Run the following command to see list of available npm scripts:

    npm run

### Tests & linting

1. Unlike majority of AdonisJs codebase, this repository follows official
   corporate Verdigris Technologies ECMAScript 6 styleguide. Run `npm run lint`
   command to check if there are any linting errors.
2. Make sure you write tests for all changes/bug fixes.
3. Also you can write **regression tests**, which shows that something is
   failing but doesn't breaks the build. Which is actually a nice way to show
   that something fails. Regression tests are written using `test.failing()`
   method.
4. Make sure all tests are passing on CircleCI.

### General practices

Most of the ES6 language features are officially supported on Node.js v8. Please
make use of the ES6 language features. For example:

1. Use [Spread syntax][mdn-js-spread] over `arguments` keyword in functions.
2. Never use `bind` or `call`. After calling these methods, AdonisJs cannot
   guarantee the scope of any methods.
3. Make sure to write proper docblock.
